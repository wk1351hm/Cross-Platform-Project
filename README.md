# Cross-Platform-Project

My idea is an application that displays lights for what you type in in morse code! To use it you will need to log in/make an account that will be stored in a database. 

Once you log in it will say “Hello (whatever your username is)” after that there will be a textbox.
Type anything you want in this textbox and click a button that says “translate” and it will translate whatever you put in the textbox into morse code!

There will be a calendar button that will display the date in morse code. To make the calendar work I will be using an google API.
